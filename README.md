Finding Similar Items
=====================

The aim of the project is to implement techniques
which can be used to find similar items.

For example, two images of sunsets might be similar
or an internet mirror of a source page might be very
similar to the source except for the mirror's information
on the page.

The plan is to take apart the stuff in this hurriedly
built course project and make it modular enough for others
to be able to use it. Another problem to figure out
is to decide if this is going to remain a MR-centric project.

If you would like to use it, you'll need to have MRJob
installed. MRJob is a map-reduce library for Python from Yelp.
